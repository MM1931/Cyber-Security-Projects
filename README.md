#Project Name: Automated Resource Integrity Checker

  Project Description: The Automated Resource Integrity Checker is a real-time monitoring solution designed to enhance system security and integrity. Users can establish a standard state of their operating system, which serves as a baseline for comparison. The software periodically checks for any additions or removals of programs at user-defined intervals. If any discrepancies are detected, the system promptly notifies the user, ensuring proactive management of software integrity and minimizing potential security risks.
